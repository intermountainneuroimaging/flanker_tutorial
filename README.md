In this tutorial, we will use a publically accessible dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000102/versions/00001). We follow along with the analysis steps described in [Andy's Brain Book](https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fMRI_Short_Course/fMRI_Intro.html). 

Contact the INC Data and Analysis team for access to the preprocessed dataset in Flywheel to compelete the tutorial.
